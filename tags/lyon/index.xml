      <description>Lyon The final stop on my Europe itinerary was France. Marie, my close friend and all around amazing person, graciously let me stay at her house in Lyon and showed me around. After arriving in Paris from Ireland, I immediately took a train to Lyon and arrived in the early evening. Lyon is probably one of the most beautiful cities I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been in. It has a beautiful combination of historical architecture and natural scenery that I&amp;rsquo;ll never forget.</description>
