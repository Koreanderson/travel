      <description>My second destination in Europe was visiting my close friend Matthew in Ireland. Matthew was also at the reunion in Amsterdam, so afer having a pint at the airport we boarded a flight for Cork, Ireland. Cork was pleasantly small but full of character. It&amp;rsquo;s a city where you can find live Irish music at the bar on any given night.
During the small time that I was in Cork I was able to walk around the city during the day and sightsee quite a bit.</description>
