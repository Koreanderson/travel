      <description>My second destination in Europe was visiting my close friend Matthew in Ireland. Matthew was also at the reunion in Amsterdam, so afer having a pint at the airport we boarded a flight for Cork, Ireland. Cork was pleasantly small but full of character. It&amp;rsquo;s a city where you can find live Irish music at the bar on any given night.
During the small time that I was in Cork I was able to walk around the city during the day and sightsee quite a bit.</description>

      <description>This log will serve as a way to keep track of some of the places that I&amp;rsquo;ve traveled over the years. Be aware that many of these accounts are being written several months after the actual trip has taken place so it might not be as detailed as I would have liked.</description>

      <description>The Netherlands was the first stop on my brief tour of the European continent. The trip came about when some of the European InKAS 2016 Summer Camp participants decided to host a reunion in Amsterdam. Initially the gathering was going to be primarily Dutch and a few other Europeans. But I was convinced to join by my good friends in the group, so I decided to stay in Europe an extra week and visit some friends.</description>
