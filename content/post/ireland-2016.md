My second destination in Europe was visiting my close friend Matthew in Ireland. Matthew was also at the reunion in Amsterdam, so afer having a pint at the airport we boarded a flight for Cork, Ireland. Cork was pleasantly small but full of character. It's a city where you can find live Irish music at the bar on any given night.

During the small time that I was in Cork I was able to walk around the city during the day and sightsee quite a bit. There's some beautiful historical architecture all within walking distance from Matthew's house. Some of the highlights were the view from the Shandon Bell Tower and touring the Cork Gaol.

One of the days we decided to rent a car and take a short drive north to Blarney. It's best known for the stone housed in Blarney Castle. There was a brutally long wait to kiss the stone we passed on that and walked the castle grounds instead.
