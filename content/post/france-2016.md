## Lyon

The final stop on my Europe itinerary was France. Marie, my close friend and all around amazing person, graciously let me stay at her house in Lyon and showed me around. After arriving in Paris from Ireland, I immediately took a train to Lyon and arrived in the early evening. Lyon is probably one of the most beautiful cities I've ever been in. It has a beautiful combination of historical architecture and natural scenery that I'll never forget.

The city is trisected by the two rivers that run through it, the Saône and the Rhône. Every street is lined with beautiful architecture and an slew of restaurants serving traditional Lyonaisse cuisine. I regret not taking any photos of the food I ate, but that's never the first thing that comes to mind while eating for me. Some of the dishes I had in Lyon were undoubtedly some of the best meals I've ever had. Highlights included touring the Traboules, taking a cable car ride and generally just walking around the city, enjoying the sites and eating food.

## Pérouges

One of the days I was visiting we took a car trip to the medieval town of Pérouges. I'm not normally a history buff, but it was something out of the ordinary walking around a cobblestone paths among buildings from another era.

One of the final days I was in France we took another car trip East towards to Swiss border to visit Annecy. Truly one of the most picturesque cities I've ever been in. The city is surrounded by mountains views of mountains and sits on a clear blue lake. We were able to take a tour around the lake and get a good look at the surrounding scenery as well as a closer look at the swarns of sailboats on the lake. Afterwards we took a drive up towards one of the surround mountains to look down upon the lake and up at the confetti of paragliders in the air.

## Annecy

The culture and cuisine of Lyon are pleasantly different to what I'm used to at home and the scenery at the mountainside were amazing. I was lucky to have the opportunity to visit France and given the chance, I would definitely go again.
